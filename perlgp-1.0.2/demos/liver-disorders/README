data from

http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary/liver-disorders

to activate the 10-fold cross-validation, copy the liver-disorders directory
into

liver-disorders-01
liver-disorders-02
liver-disorders-03
..
liver-disorders-10


then run each one.

you'll see that each one uses a different combination of train/test data.

you can concatenate all the */results/recent.testing.output files into one
and calculate the performance on that (to give an idea of overall
performance).  however, you do end up with 10 different classifiers.

to run the entire set as train *and* test, edit Algorithm.pm and

replace

    if (($file eq 'test' && $chunk == $leave_out_chunk) ||
	($file eq 'train' && $chunk != $leave_out_chunk)) {

with 

    if (1) {
